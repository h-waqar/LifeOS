## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1 Decision]: ORM confirmed: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Prisma rejected to eliminate unresolved technology choices.
- [Phase 1 Decision]: Authentication confirmed: Better Auth with secure HTTP-only cookies. NextAuth and custom Argon2 alternatives rejected.
- [Phase 1 Decision]: Strict Separation of Concerns: Authentication verifies identity; application authorization enforces resource ownership using the authenticated user's user_id. Client-supplied user IDs are never trusted.
- [Phase 1 Decision]: Phase 1 Database Boundary: Strictly limited to foundational/authentication tables (users, sessions/Better Auth required tables, preferences if required, audit_log). Domain tables (Task, Project, Goal, Habit, Calendar, Note, Person, Interaction, Finance, Content, AI, etc.) are strictly prohibited upfront.
- [Phase 1 Decision]: Vertical-Slice Rule: Domain schemas must be introduced with the phase that implements their corresponding functionality.
- [Phase 1 Decision]: Relationships / People CRM: Person and Interaction entities from PRD Section 25 are not deferred to v2; added to Phase 3 alongside Knowledge & Learning.
- [Phase 1 Init]: Full-stack Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript (strict mode) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.
- [Phase 1 Init]: Mandatory Human-in-the-Loop confirmation gate for all AI mutation tools.
